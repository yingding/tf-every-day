# tf-every-day
This ist a repository for learning series TensorFlow 2.x on every day.

## Goal
At the time of writing, the TensorFlow library has reached version 2.4.1. The way of writing code is fundamental different from tf version 1.5.x.
The author of this repository intends to add as much examples of how to use differet models with TensorFlow version 2.x. Starting from using Regression models in Keras, loading csv files with Panda to build a [custom model with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/custom_training_walkthrough) and define a [custom Keras Layer](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/custom_layers). It is not recommended to write model with low level tf 2.x api anymore, since the low level apis skip the model pipeline in [TFX](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide).

The author of this repository has limited time to contribute. If you have any question regarding TensorFlow 2.x, please post your question on [Stack Overflow - tensorflow2.x](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow2.x). 

Should the author of this repository has further free capacity, further tensorflow 2.x examples such as distributed training, federated learning or model training on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) might also be added. Time is always a limited factor in life besides family and work. Wish you a good time searching through the examples you might be interested in.
